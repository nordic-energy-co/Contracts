# Nordic Energy´s Smart Contracts

Smart contracts based (EOSIO) delegated proof-of-stake consensus protocol. Smart Contract aims to provide a novel blockchain solution to meet the speed and scalability required.


### Token Economy:

The NET token is used on the Nordic Energy platform. The Nordic Energy token will fuel Nordic Energy’s blockchain-based technologies, facilitate access to Nordic Energy ecosystem, allowing global platform interoperability. NET tokens powers all the transactions within the microgrids, solar power plants, wind parks, electric vehicles charging points and power stations. 

NET token is a very efficient payment method and transaction engine of choice. This is key for enabling frictionless transactions inside these closed environments. Nordic Energy own payment processors without the cumbersome or costly aspects of traditional financial settlement options, where tokens provide a much lower barrier for processing end-to-end transactions inside a given market.
