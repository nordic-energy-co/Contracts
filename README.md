## Smart Contract Architechture



### Protocol:

Smart contracts runs on the Delegated Proof of Stake protocol, staking is more energy efficient compared to replace with the actual physical transfer of solar and wind energy, and for now, sit the principles of the energy solutions to better than other renewable energy protocols and using a multiple differential platform. 

Smart Contract aims to provide a novel blockchain solution to meet the speed and scalability required. Nordic Energy PowerChain Is a highly scalable, next generation blockchain platform. Our architecture goes beyond state of the art and can be seen as an to achieve a better state between security, most fastest transactions, scalability and decentralization, allowing each node in the shard to determine the members of the consensus. 


### Token Economy:

The NET token is used on the Nordic Energy platform. The Nordic Energy token will fuel Nordic Energy’s blockchain-based technologies, facilitate access to Nordic Energy ecosystem, allowing global platform interoperability. Nordic Energy token powers all the transactions within the microgrids, solar power plants, wind parks, electric vehicles charging points and power stations. 

NET token is a very efficient payment method and transaction engine of choice. This is key for enabling frictionless transactions inside these closed environments. Nordic Energy own payment processors without the cumbersome or costly aspects of traditional financial settlement options, where tokens provide a much lower barrier for processing end-to-end transactions inside a given market.
