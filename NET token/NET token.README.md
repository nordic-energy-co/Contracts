# What Is NET Token?


### The NET token is used on the Nordic Energy platform: 

The Nordic Energy token will fuel Nordic Energy’s blockchain-based technologies, facilitate access to Nordic Energy ecosystem, allowing global platform interoperability. NET tokens powers all the transactions within the microgrids, solar power plants, wind parks, electric vehicles charging points and power stations. 

NET token is a very efficient payment method and transaction engine of choice. This is key for enabling frictionless transactions inside these closed environments. Nordic Energy own payment processors without the cumbersome or costly aspects of traditional financial settlement options, where tokens provide a much lower barrier for processing end-to-end transactions inside a given market.




### Protocol:

Smart contracts based (EOSIO) delegated proof-of-stake consensus protocol. Smart Contract aims to provide a novel blockchain solution to meet the speed and scalability required.



#### The Currency:

•	The token is a very efficient payment method and transaction engine of choice. This is key for enabling frictionless transactions inside these closed environments. Corporation and companies can be their own payment processors without the cumbersome or costly aspects of traditional financial settlement options. 


#### Utility Token:

•	Nordic Energy (NET) token is a utility token that serves as a priority access to the energy auctions, ecosystem, allow energy trading, and buy for goods.

### NET Token Features:


- Platform architecture: Is a highly scalable, next generation blockchain platform. Our architecture goes beyond state of the art and can be seen as an to achieve a better state between security, most fastest transactions, scalability and decentralization, allowing each node in the shard to determine the members of the consensus. 

- Multi-token economy:  Service into multi-tokens enabling referrers in a referral-chain to refer portions of the to create opportunities, transfer and share values more seamlessly than ever before.

- Referrals & Rewards: User earn our tokens for referrals, advertise, product views, app usage and blockchain-based decentralized capacity market. NET tokens enable retailers to become advertisers. use NET token to promote and advertising to get rewards.

- Tradeable: Purchase and sale of energy via smart contracts, provide flexible yet standardized power purchase process. Blockchain based technological solution allows transparent ecosystem and energy on demand accounting. 

- Transactions: In Nordic Energy runs on the Delegated Proof of Stake protocol, staking is more energy efficient compared to replace with the actual physical transfer of solar and wind energy, and for now, sit the principles of the energy solutions to better than other renewable energy protocols and using a multiple differential platform. 
Energy Smart Contract: Purchase and sale of energy via smart contracts. Our Smart Contract makes traditionally complex and expensive transactions easier, faster and cheaper.

- Exchange: Selling energy directly to your neighbours at your local electricity company using cryptocurrency. Prosumer exchanges their generated power with utility in the form of renewable energy in decentralized platform, where the Nordic Energy tokens/coins ensures liquidity and extends access to capital.
